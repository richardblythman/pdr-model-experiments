ACT001:
Uses a time frame of 1m and 60 mins in the past. LR, LASSO and Baseline
Baseline give the lower error. Baseline is a Maringale distribution such that
x(t+1)/[x(t),x(t-1)...x(t-N)] = x(t+1)/x(t)

ACT002:
Repeats ACT001 but the prediction is the change in price (derivative)

ACT003:
Use different SMAs, Bollinger bands and RSI as features

ACT004:
Adds btc data for prediction. for small periods perfromance seems to be better than the baseline.
Also the model seems to have information about the chnage in price, with accuracy of 56% predicting the sign of the change

ACT005:
Attempt to predict directly the sign of the change

ACT006
get data for eth and btc since 2017 (max available from binance)

ACT007
Simple linear regression to predict next ETH price value
features are standard indicators given by "ta lib"
score = MAE
OLS 0.7278
Baseline: 0.7247
Lasso: 1.082

Baseline is just using the current value as prediction for the next value
Notice that this produces a lower (better) score than the models tested 

ACT008
Try to predict the direction of the change. this is a classification problem
where the labels ar the sign of the difference of the price now and in the future
that is, the labels are -1 or 1 indicating that the price goes down or up
Keep the same features.

For 1h data the results are
y_h	        y_l	        y_c
0.682293	0.699570	0.540750
0.453838	0.555806	0.502445
0.546162	0.444194	0.497555

Showing that is possible to classify the direction of the changes
for high and low, the direction of the close value classification is questionable and 
randomization test is required to determine if the result is statistically significant

using the 1m timeframe data
y_h	        y_l	        y_c
0.723721	0.728350	0.509283
0.466143	0.529188	0.497734
0.533857	0.470812	0.502266

the accuracy is higher for high and low, but lower for the prediction
of the direction of the close values

ACT009
Explore how the values open, high, low and volume are related to the close value
The caveat is that either high and low could be also the close value, however if there is any relationship among those values
it can be used later given that previous activities show that it is possible to 
predict High and low easier than close.

The prediction of close from the same interval paarmeters high, low, open and volume gives about
MAE of 0.31 in the tet setment (10%) of the data, The MAE between close and open is 0.72

ACT010 
determine if having 100% knowledge of the direction of the price change has a positive effect on the prediction of the future prices
Knowledge of the direction redice the rror in the estiomation of the close value by 30% compared to the base line
the prediction of the high value is reduced about 40% compared to use the baseline. A similar result is observed for "low"

Notice that invariably knowing the direction implies successful trades always, assuming that fees are not an issue

ACT011
Calcule the direction of the chnages and use it to determine the profit obtained using the available data
Contaminate the directionprediction with different levels of noise, determine the accuracy and calculate the returns

ACT012
Can the direction of the close value be calculated from the other variables that are not the close price?
results show 80%, while this is not predictive realistically it can be used in the case that the high or low values are easier to calculate

ACT013
Use a densely connected ANN with non linear activations to predict the direction of the change in the close values
use 3 layers, which in theory would be able to model an arbitrary non-linear function given sufficient data
